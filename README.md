# Flower_ConvNet

Developed Convolutional Network Deep learning model for Flower Datset for practice.

### Data used:
Used Kaggle Flower dataset for developing the Deep Learning model with ConvNet.

### Motivation
Tried using kaggle dataset by directly downlaoding the dataset in Google Colab by installing Kaggle APIs and authenticating.
